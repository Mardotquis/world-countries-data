# World Countries Data Project

Welcome to my World Countries Data Project for Ognomy 👋🏾. Project is hosted at: https://incredible-belekoy-5f6927.netlify.app/

This project is written in React while utilizing [Taildwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Fuse.js](https://fusejs.io/) under the hood.

## Getting Started

First, install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

Then, start the app:

```bash
npm start
```

Finally, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the application.

## About the project
- I'm using [Taildwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling because it's a lightweight CSS utility library that's easy to use for both quick, easy projects and complex component libraries.
- I decided to rely on [Fuse.js](https://fusejs.io/) for fuzzy searching to take advantage of their built-in APIs to search multiple indexes at once
